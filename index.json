At 37 °C, tunneling was computed to enhance the rate by 38–40% over the transition-state theory rate. Intramolecular 12C/13C kinetic isotope effects were predicted to be substantial, with a steep temperature dependence. These results are discussed in relation to recent experimental findings that show heavy-atom tunneling at moderate temperatures. The calculations point to the possibility of a simple computational test for the likelihood of heavy-atom tunneling using standard quantum-chemical information.","tags":[],"title":"Computational Evidence for Heavy-Atom Tunneling in the Bergman Cyclization of a 10-Membered-Ring Enediyne","type":"publication"}]
